# Dusk

A bare-bones, skeleton starter theme for Shopify. To be clear, Dusk is not intended to be a production theme. It doesn't really do anything, and, therefore, brings zero value to merchants in its current state. Dusk is a _starting point_, for you, the developer, with minimal boilerplate and zero opinions.

## From Dusk to Dawn

Shopify's [Dawn](https://themes.shopify.com/themes/dawn/styles/default) theme is impressive—_very_ impressive, and robust—but in their own words, Dawn is a **reference** theme for developers. By definition then, it shouldn't be a starting point. It should be a reference point. It is far easier to copy and paste _from_ Dawn _into_ Dusk than it is to try to deconstruct Dawn in its finished state and remove the parts of Dawn that you wish not to use.

If Dawn is the _Pheonix_, Dusk is the _ashes_.

**FUN FACT:** I considered naming this theme simply "Dust" because that's basically all it is. It's nothing. It's the particles. It's the bare minimum to get the Online Store Editor to load and for something to display on the front end. However, I felt that "Dusk" was better aligned with the "Dawn" name.

## Conclusion

There is a lot we can learn from [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn), so keep its code close by and reference it often as you build out Dusk.
